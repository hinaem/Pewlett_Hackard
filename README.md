# Pewlett_Hackard

Overview of the analysis:
1. In this project I have helped Bobby receive a clear understanding of how many employees are eligible of retirement packages and how many more positions we will need to fill going in the near future. It is important to understand this in a busy company like Pewlett Hackard because if we end up short staffed it will cause difficulties in keeping up with the day to day jobs that must be done. It can become a serious problem for production and maintaining a successful company. Also it is good  practice to hire new employees before the current employees go on to retirement because they can learn a lot from the current employees, to result in a smooth transition. 
 
2.. From the two analysis deliverables I have presented I believe the below are major point that should be looked on upon
      - From the retiring titles csv file that I created from the unique titles table  we can see by each type of position how many people are retiring. This will tell us how many people we have to hire.
      - Our retirement titles table tells us a combined breakdown of each individual about to retire and retired, which can be used to know how 
      - Our mentorship eligibility tells us that we have 1,549 employees who are eligible for mentoring.
      
3. Based on my results we would need to fill 72,458 many roles as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact.
